# Documentation for the Mozmill Repository

There are several entry points where it is desirable to have documentation available:

- the MDN project page(s) for mozmill: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill

- the mozmill github repository: http://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill

- the python package index: URL NEEDED

- in a source checkout alongside the code

- on the AMO page: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9018/


### Where the Documentation goes

Several packages exist in the [mozmill repository](http://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill):

* [mozmill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill) : driver,
  event-dispatcher, and test harness

* jsbridge : python to JavaScript bridge interface

* mozrunner : Handles start/stop automation of Mozilla applications

* mozprofile : handling of Mozilla XUL app profiles

* mozprocess : low-level process management

* mozinfo : gather system information

* mutt : test harness for mozmill and other denizens of the Mozmill
  repo

Each of these packages contains a 'README' file as well as 
possibly various other documentation files in a 'docs/'
directory. These markdown files serve as the documentation canon.
