# Mozmill

[Mozmill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill) is a UI Automation
framework for Mozilla apps like Firefox and Thunderbird. It's both an
[addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9018/) and a
Python command-line tool. The addon provides an IDE for writing and
running the JavaScript tests and the Python package provides a
mechanism for running the tests from the command line as well as
providing a way to test restarting the application.
