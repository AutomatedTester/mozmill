# Installing Mozmill

[Mozmill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill) 
can be installed as an extension or from the python source.

## Installing the Extenstion

The Mozmill extension can be installed from 
[its home on addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9018).
Or open the "Get Add-ons" tab of the Add-ons Manager and search for
Mozmill.


## Installing the Mozmill Python Package

If you have [python](http://python.org) on your computer you will be
able to install and utilize the Mozmill python package.

Depending on your needs, you may want to install Mozmill from its
[Python Package Index page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mozmill) or
its [github repository](https://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill). In
either case, you will need 
[setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) and
it is highly recommended that you use 
[virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) to keep your python
environment separate from your system packages.
