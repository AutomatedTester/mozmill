# Installing Mozmill

[Mozmill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozmill) 
can be installed as an extension or from the python source.

## Installing the Extenstion

The Mozmill extension can be installed from 
[its home on addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9018).
Or open the "Get Add-ons" tab of the Add-ons Manager and search for
Mozmill.


## Installing the Mozmill Python Package

If you have [python](http://python.org) on your computer you will be
able to install and utilize the Mozmill python package.

Depending on your needs, you may want to install Mozmill from its
[Python Package Index page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mozmill) or
its [github repository](https://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill). In
either case, you will need 
[setuptools](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools) and
it is highly recommended that you use 
[virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) to keep your python
environment separate from your system packages.


### Using virtualenv

[virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) is a tool to create isolated
Python environments. If you have `pip` or `easy_install` on your
system, you can run `pip install virtualenv` or `easy_install
virtualenv` to install it, or download the source from
[pypi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) or the
[github repository](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv).

Once you have virtualenv installed, you can make an environment for 
Mozmill, e.g.:

    virtualenv mozmill

Run the activate script for your platform.  For e.g. linux:

    cd mozmill
    . bin/activate

It is recommended that you make a `src` directory for Mozmill and
other packages you are interested in developing:

    mkdir src
    cd src


### Installing from github

The prefered installation method is from the 
[github mozautomation/mozmill repository](https://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill/). 


### Installing from PyPI

If you have `easy_install` or `pip` (both of which come packaged with
virtualenv), you can install mozmill and its dependencies with a
single command:

    easy_install mozmill

or:

    pip install mozmill
