# mozprocess

mozprocess provides process management in an OS-transparent interface.
Mozprocess aims to ensure the ability to robustly terminate a process
on Windows, OS X, and Linux.  Mozprocess utilizes and extends
`subprocess.Popen` to these ends

## TODO

- Document API

- Document improvements over `subprocess.Popen.kill`
